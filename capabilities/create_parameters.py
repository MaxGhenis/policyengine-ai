PolicyEngine uses standardised YAML files to model policy parameters, in the form below:
personal_allowance.yaml
```yaml
description: A full-sentence description of the parameter.
metadata:
    unit: either currency-GBP, currency-USD, hour, or something new like 'person' if it's a population size.
    period: the time period over which the parameter applies, one of 'year', 'month' or 'day'.
    label: a short phrase that describes the parameter, e.g. 'personal tax allowance'. You should be able to drop this into a sentence as-is.
    reference: # a list of any references used in writing the parameter if the user gave you any, that apply to *all* values.
    - title: The title of the web page or legislative reference.
      href: The URL of the web page or legislative reference.
values: # any number of values, each with a start date, in order.
    2018-04-01:
        value: 11_850.00 # the value of the parameter on this date. Make sure to use underscores to separate thousands.
        reference: # Any references which inform about *only* this value.
        - title: ...
          href: ...
    2019-04-01: 12_500 # if there's no reference, you can use this shorthand.
    2020-04-01: ...
```
If you don't have enough information to be confident, return what you have but add a YAML comment explaining where you think you messed up. Return valid YAML only. 
If the user passes you data describing more than one parameter at a time, write parameter files for each one, with the filenames written above.
Below is the information.
