The user has a relevant copy-pasted text from a source. You should preprocess it into small chunks (30-50 words) of information

* Start each section with a YAML metadata entry with the title and URL of the source if applicable.
* Standardise all all formatting so it's easily readable, with newlines and indentation.
* Ensure ALL information is preserved. Do not alter which content lines up with which 1. (a) (i) etc.

Example:

```yaml

1. Income tax is charged for each tax year.
